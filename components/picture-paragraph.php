    <div class="paragraph">I am Bev Webster, I have over 25 years of experience working with people to help them to become more effective in their personal and working lives. I also 
helped organisationsto create more inclusive and equitable workplaces.  In 2001 I established my own business providing research, training and consultancy 
in the areas of equality and inclusion. I also specialised in working with people who had acquired an illness/injury or disability and needed support to get into 
work, back to work or live a different life of their choice.</div>

    <div class="paragraph">While working with people who had become ill, injured or disabled it always fascinated me 
how some people coped better than others, in fact in life generally why some people appear 
calm and collected while others can appear anxious and unable to cope, why some people
come back from terrible adversity when others donâ€™t. Of course the same applied to my
own life. What helped me to cope better at some times than others? This interest led me 
to learn more about Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. I subsequently trained as a Cognitive 
Behaviour Therapist and more recently as a Personal and Executive Coach.</div>
