    <div class="paragraph">I am Bev Webster, I have over 25 years of experience working with people to help them to become more effective in their personal and working lives. I also 
helped organisationsto create more inclusive and equitable workplaces.  In 2001 I established my own business providing research, training and consultancy 
in the areas of equality and inclusion. I also specialised in working with people who had acquired an illness/injury or disability and needed support to get into 
work, back to work or live a different life of their choice.</div>
